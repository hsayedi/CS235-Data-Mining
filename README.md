# CS235-Data-Mining


This project contains a K-Means Clustering by Husna Sayedi and a Neural Network Implementation by Kevin Vega. 
Our third teammamte Shahab Geravesh did his work in SPSS, therefore it is not included in this repository. 

To run both implementations, execute the python file: 

```
python run.py
```

Note: 
When the code is running through the K-Means code, it may output a series of plots. Close each plot after viewing to allow 
the execution of the code to continue.
