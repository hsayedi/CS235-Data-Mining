# CS235-Data-Mining


This project contains a K-Means Clustering by Husna Sayedi and a Neural Network Implementation by Kevin Vega. 
Our third teammamte Shahab Geravesh did his work in SPSS, therefore it is not included in this repository. 

## Running the Code
Note: 
When the code is running through the K-Means code, it may output a series of plots. Close each plot after viewing to allow 
the execution of the code to continue. 
To run both implementations, execute the python file: 

```
python run.py
```

## K-Means Algorithm 

Seeing the file ```airbnb_nyc.ipynb``` shows a more complete version of code and plots. It also includes commentary 
for easier navigation. The file ```KMeans.py``` is essentially the same code but in a python file.
